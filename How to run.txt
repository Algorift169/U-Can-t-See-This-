How to Run
Code Compilation:
Open the extracted folder in VS Code.

Open PowerShell in the project directory.

Compile the executable files in the build folder:

powershell
# For encryption
g++ Cryptography/encryption.cpp Cryptography/matrix_utils.cpp -o build/encryption.exe -std=c++11

# For decryption
g++ Cryptography/decryption.cpp Cryptography/matrix_utils.cpp -o build/decryption.exe -std=c++11

Running the Program:
Open two separate terminals in VS Code.

In the first terminal, run:

powershell
.\build\encryption.exe
In the second terminal, run:

powershell
.\build\decryption.exe
The two programs should now be running and communicating (likely via IPC, sockets, or shared memory).


How to Run on Linux (Kali)
1. Open the project in VS Code

Open VS Code → File → Open Folder → select your project folder.

2. Open a terminal in VS Code

Press Ctrl + ` (backtick) to open an integrated terminal.

Make sure you are in the project directory.

3. Compile the programs

On Linux, executables don’t need .exe, and paths use / instead of \.

# Create the build folder if it doesn't exist
mkdir -p build

# Compile encryption
g++ Cryptography/encryption.cpp Cryptography/matrix_utils.cpp -o build/encryption -std=c++11

# Compile decryption
g++ Cryptography/decryption.cpp Cryptography/matrix_utils.cpp -o build/decryption -std=c++11


✅ After this, you should have two executables in build/:

build/encryption

build/decryption

4. Run the programs

Open two separate terminals in VS Code.

Terminal 1:

./build/encryption


Terminal 2:

./build/decryption


The programs will now run and communicate (via IPC, sockets, or shared memory) just like in Windows.

How to Run
Code Compilation:
Open the extracted folder in VS Code.

Open PowerShell in the project directory.

Compile the executable files in the build folder:

powershell
# For encryption
g++ Cryptography/encryption.cpp Cryptography/matrix_utils.cpp -o build/encryption.exe -std=c++11

# For decryption
g++ Cryptography/decryption.cpp Cryptography/matrix_utils.cpp -o build/decryption.exe -std=c++11

Running the Program:
Open two separate terminals in VS Code.

In the first terminal, run:

powershell
.\build\encryption.exe
In the second terminal, run:

powershell
.\build\decryption.exe
The two programs should now be running and communicating (likely via IPC, sockets, or shared memory).
